# The Point of it All

There will be a point in the semester when you start to learn about these things called Vector Spaces and what it means to be in a Space.
Likely, it will seem needlessly theoretical and you will wonder, so what? One of the many ways to solve math problems is to generalize.
Linear Algebra is a formalization of many similiar forms of math; It acts as a glue. Lin alg unifies many of the mathematical ideas you've 
seen up until this point. From the familiar geometry, cartesian plane, and thus undefined space in which we do calculus that you're
used to; To solutions of polynomial equations, matrices; Ideas of mappings, functions and distance; signal processing, and endless others. 
You can think of thisclass as a slight preview to the world of math theory. Learning the unifying ideas between different types of math 
allows borderline endless problem solving in the domain of your chosing.

Don't mean to pressure you to pick apple... but you should :-)

Something to think about: 
if 3 lines intersect in 3D, what does it mean for a system of linear equations to model that; what else could that system describe?
Hint: it's a lot
