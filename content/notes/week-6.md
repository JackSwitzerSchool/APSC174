## Week 6 Summary

This week we covered two main topics:

### 1. Matrices and Solving Systems of Linear Equations

- Introduction to [[matrix|matrices]] and their properties
- Methods for [[solving-systems-of-linear-equations|solving systems of linear equations]]
- [[rref|Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF)]] and its properties
- [[gaussian-elim|Gaussian Elimination]] as a systematic procedure

### 2. Vector Space Foundations

- [[gen-sets|Generating Sets]] (spanning sets) for vector spaces
- [[basis|Bases]] and their properties
- Coordinates with respect to a basis

### Key Concepts

- A [[matrix|matrix]] is a rectangular array of numbers that can represent systems of linear equations
- [[gaussian-elim|Gaussian Elimination]] is a method to transform a matrix into [[rref|RREF]]
- A [[gen-sets|generating set]] for a vector space is a set of vectors whose span equals the entire space
- A [[basis|basis]] is a linearly independent generating set

### Applications

- Solving [[systems-of-linear-equations|systems of linear equations]] efficiently
- Finding unique representations of vectors in terms of basis elements
- Determining whether a system has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution
