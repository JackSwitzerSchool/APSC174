A [[mapping|Function]] is surjective when all elements of the co-domain are mapped to.

This is also called "Onto"

Formally: 
$$\forall y\in \mathbb{Y}, \exists x \in \mathbb{X} \text{ s.t. } f(x)=y$$

or "For all elements $y$ in $\mathbb{Y}$, there exists an $x$ in $\mathbb{X}$ such that $f$ at $x$ is equal to $y$

## Exercise
Show that if two functions $f$ and $g$ are [[surjective|Surjective]] so is $g \bullet f$.
Show an example of where $g \bullet f$ is [[surjective|Surjective]] but $f$ is not.
