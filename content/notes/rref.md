## Definition
A [[matrix|matrix]] is in **Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)** if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. All rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the [[matrix|matrix]].
2. The leading entry (first non-zero element) of each non-zero row is 1 (called a pivot).
3. Each leading 1 appears to the right of the leading 1 in the row above it.
4. Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column.

## Importance
RREF is a standardized form that makes it easy to:
- Identify the solution set of a system of linear equations
- Determine the rank of a [[matrix|matrix]]
- Find a basis for the column space, row space, and null space
- Identify whether a system has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution

## Relationship to Gaussian Elimination
RREF is the end result of the [[gaussian-elim|Gaussian elimination]] process. While Gaussian elimination describes the procedure, RREF describes the final form we want to achieve.

## Example
Consider the augmented [[matrix|matrix]] representing the system of equations:
$$
\begin{align}
x + 2y - z &= 3 \\
2x + y + z &= 8 \\
3x - y - z &= 2
\end{align}
$$

The augmented [[matrix|matrix]] is:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\
2 & 1 & 1 & 8 \\
3 & -1 & -1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

After applying [[gaussian-elim|Gaussian elimination]], the RREF is:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This tells us that the unique solution is $x = 2$, $y = 1$, and $z = 0$.

## Properties
1. **Uniqueness**: Every [[matrix|matrix]] has a unique RREF.
2. **Row Operations**: RREF is achieved through elementary row operations:
   - Swapping rows
   - Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar
   - Adding a multiple of one row to another
3. **Rank**: The number of non-zero rows in the RREF equals the rank of the [[matrix|matrix]].

## Applications
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Finding the inverse of a [[matrix|matrix]]
- Computing the rank of a [[matrix|matrix]]
- Determining bases for fundamental subspaces
- Analyzing the solution space of homogeneous systems
