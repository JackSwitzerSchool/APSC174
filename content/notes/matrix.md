## Definition
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Formally, an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Types of Matrices

1. **Square Matrix**: A matrix with the same number of rows and columns ($m = n$)
2. **Identity Matrix**: A square matrix with 1's on the main diagonal and 0's elsewhere
3. **Augmented Matrix**: A matrix used to represent a system of linear equations
4. **Zero Matrix**: A matrix with all elements equal to zero
5. **Diagonal Matrix**: A square matrix with non-zero elements only on the main diagonal
6. **Triangular Matrix**: 
   - Upper triangular: non-zero elements only on and above the main diagonal
   - Lower triangular: non-zero elements only on and below the main diagonal
7. **Symmetric Matrix**: A square matrix equal to its transpose ($A = A^T$)


## Matrix Operations

### Addition and Subtraction
For matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same dimensions:
$$(A \pm B)_{ij} = A_{ij} \pm B_{ij}$$

### Scalar Multiplication
For a scalar $c$ and matrix $A$:
$$(cA)_{ij} = c \cdot A_{ij}$$

### Matrix Multiplication
For an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and an $n \times p$ matrix $B$:
$$(AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik} \cdot B_{kj}$$

### Transpose
The transpose of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is the $n \times m$ matrix $A^T$ where:
$$(A^T)_{ij} = A_{ji}$$

## Properties and Applications

### Determinant
For a square matrix, the determinant is a scalar value that provides information about the matrix's invertibility and the volume scaling factor of the linear transformation it represents.

### Inverse
A square matrix $A$ has an inverse $A^{-1}$ if $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.

### Rank
The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated by its columns (or rows).

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
For a square matrix $A$, a non-zero vector $v$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda$ if $Av = \lambda v$.

## Applications

1. **Systems of Linear Equations**: Matrices provide a compact way to represent and solve systems using methods like [[gaussian-elim|Gaussian elimination]] and [[rref|Row-Reduced Echelon Form]].

2. **Linear Transformations**: Matrices represent linear transformations between vector spaces.

3. **Computer Graphics**: Transformation matrices are used for rotation, scaling, and translation in 2D and 3D graphics.

4. **Data Science**: Matrices are fundamental in techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Regression.

5. **Quantum Mechanics**: Matrices represent observables and transformations in quantum systems.

## Computational Methods

Various algorithms exist for matrix operations, including:
- LU Decomposition
- QR Factorization
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Eigenvalue Decomposition
