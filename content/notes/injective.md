A [[mapping|Function]] is injective when different elements of the domain are mapped to different elements of the codomain.

This is also called "One-to-One"

Formally:
$$\forall x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{X}, f(x_1)=f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1=x_2$$

or "For all elements $x_1, x_2$ in $\mathbb{X}$. If $f$ of $x_1$ equals $f$ of $x_2$ that implies that $x_1$ equals $x_2$"

## Exercise
Show that if $g \bullet f$ is [[injective|Injective]] then $f$ is [[injective|Injective]].
Show an example of where $g \bullet f$ is [[injective|Injective]] but $g$ is not.
