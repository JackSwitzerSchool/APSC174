## Week 7 Summary

This week we explored three fundamental concepts in linear algebra that build upon our understanding of vector spaces:

### 1. [[vector-space-dimension|Dimensions of Vector Spaces]]

- The concept of dimension as the size of a basis
- The key lemma relating linearly independent sets and spanning sets

### 2. [[linear-transformations|Linear Transformations]]

- Definition and properties of linear transformations
- Matrix representations of linear transformations
- Composition of linear transformations

### 3. [[null-space|Null Spaces and Kernels]]

- Definition of null space (kernel) of a linear transformation
- Relationship between null space and solutions to homogeneous systems

### Key Lemma

One of the most important results we covered is:

> **Key Lemma**: Let V be a vector space, and suppose that {u₁, u₂, ..., uₐ} is a set of linearly independent vectors in V, and that {v₁, v₂, ..., vᵦ} is a spanning set for V. Then a ≤ b.

This lemma establishes that:
- Any linearly independent set can have at most as many vectors as any spanning set
- All bases of a vector space have the same number of elements
- The dimension of a vector space is well-defined
