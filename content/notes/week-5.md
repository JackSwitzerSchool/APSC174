## Week 5 Summary

Your [[Midterm-1|first Midterm]] is coming up on Tuesday, February 11th 2025

### Additional Review
I posted some [[videos]] going over past midterm examples

I'm teaching the [EngLinks](https://linktr.ee/englinks?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabEz6u0ydugTzstbteV8uACjSfhg3KuV_OhpbnUvtrgzmSRx_fYZssc5l4_aem_G3qSW0kRxCPGIZMoYXVECA) review session on Saturday Feb 8th from 2:00-4:00pm in Stirling Aud

Additionally, I'll be running a last minute help desk on Monday Feb 10th for EngLinks from 6:00-9:00pm in BMH 313

As always, [Exit Poll](https://forms.gle/TQXnRuSMDzQYZZky7) from class this week

Good Luck!

Jack
