## Week 11 Overview

This week we explored the fascinating concept of [[determinant|determinants]] and their geometric interpretation as scaling factors in linear transformations.

### Key Concepts

- **Determinants as Scaling**: We learned that the determinant tells us how a transformation scales areas (2D) or volumes (3D)
  - A determinant of 2 means the area doubles
  - A determinant of 0.5 means the area halves
  - Negative determinants indicate a flip in orientation

- **Connection to [[invertibility|Invertibility]]**: We discovered that matrices are only invertible when their determinant is non-zero, which geometrically means the transformation doesn't collapse space into a lower dimension

### Looking Ahead

Next week, we'll build on these concepts to explore:
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- How determinants help us find eigenvalues
- Applications in computer graphics and physics
