## Week 12 Overview

This week covered [[eigen-stuff|eigenvalues and eigenvectors]] and their properties.

### Key Concepts

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
  - Definition: $T(v) = \lambda v$ for non-zero $v$
  - $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue (scalar)
  - $v$ is the eigenvector (direction preserved under transformation)

- **[[characteristic-polynomial|Characteristic Polynomial]]**
  - $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ gives eigenvalues
  - Connects to [[determinant|determinants]] from last week

- **Eigenspaces**
  - Set of all eigenvectors for a given eigenvalue
  - Geometric multiplicity = dimension of eigenspace
