## Why Abstract?
Abstraction in mathematics allows us to:

1) Identify common patterns across different areas
2) Develop general tools that work in many contexts
3) Solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler parts
4) Build up from basic principles to advanced concepts

The power of abstraction lies in its ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas and provide a unified framework for understanding mathematical concepts.
