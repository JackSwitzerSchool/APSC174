## Axioms:
A [[vector-space|Vector Space]] is defined as a set $\mathbb{V}$, alongside two operations: "+" and "·"

Consider arbitrary: vectors: $x,y,z \in \mathbb{V}$ and scalars: $a,b,c \in \mathbb{F}$ (The field of scalars is often $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$)

1) Associativity of "+"
- Associativity is define by the ability to group sequential operations in any order. denoted: $$(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$$

2) Existence of the Zero Vector - Additive Identity
- There is some "Zero Vector" in $\mathbb{V}$ that acts as an "additive identity".
- Or, adding "Zero" to any element will end up with the same element. denoted: $$\forall v \in \mathbb{V}, \exists "0" \text{ s.t. } v+0=0+v=v$$

3) Existence of the Additive Inverse
- All vectors $v$ in your space has a corresponding "-v" in the space such that: $$v+(-v)=(-v)+v=0$$

4) Commutitivity of "+"
- Simply, the "+" operation is symmetric: $$x+y=y+x$$

5) Associativity of "·"
- $$(x·y)·z=x·(y·z)$$

6) Distributive Laws of "·" and "+"
- $$a·(x+y)=(a·x)+(a·y)$$

7) Distributive Laws of "+" and "·"
- $$v·(a+b)=(v·a)+(v·b)$$

8) Existence of the 1 Vector - Multiplicitive Identity
- $$\forall v \in \mathbb{V}, \exists "1" \text{ s.t. } 1·v=v·1=v$$
