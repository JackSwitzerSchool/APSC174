The empty set or the null set denoted $\emptyset = \{\}$ is the set containing *no* elements

This has useful "annihilation" properties similar to other identity elements such as the additive identify 0. 
NOTE: This does not mean $0=\emptyset$

## Fun Fact:
The empty set $\emptyset$ isn't just "nothing" — it's the building block of all natural numbers! Using a clever definition in set theory, mathematicians construct numbers like $0 = \emptyset$, $1=\{ \emptyset \}$ , $2 = \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}$, and so on. So, in a sense, every number is made of nothing—just organized differently!
