- Basic skills from calculus (differentiating elementary functions like $\sin x$, $\cos x$, $e^x$, $\ln x$; product and chain rules) and trigonometry (such as identities: $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$, $\cos(2x) = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x$, and $\sin(2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x$) are assumed.

**Reminder**: Calculators are **not permitted** during the test.
